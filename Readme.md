# Static Analysis Project Code
This repository contains all the code for the second task of the Project.

It contains all binaries needed (even though it's bad practice).

After installing and initializing nix, you can add the env variable containing a Gemini token and run the analysis.

Further this file contains the resulting leaks linked in the paper.
